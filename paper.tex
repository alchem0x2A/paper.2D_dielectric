\title{Unified Understanding of the Dielectric Nature of Two-Dimensional Materials}
\begin{document}

\newpage{}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org2ea169d}

The central place of dielectric properties, especially the static
dielectric constant in material research
\cite{Dressel_2001_electrodynamics} drives the pursuit for a unified
model between the electronic and dielectric properties of materials.
In fact, some pioneering work\cite{Moss_1950_relation} discovered
relationships between the dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ and other
physical properties, in particular the band gap $E_{\mathrm{g}}$
(minimal optical transition energy) of bulk
semiconductors. Moss\cite{Moss_1950_relation,Moss_1985_n_Eg} showed
that $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ and $\varepsilon$ follow a semi-empirical
relationship, known as the Moss relation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Moss-relations}
\varepsilon^{2} E_{\mathrm{g}} \approx 95\ \mathrm{eV}
\end{equation}
Other similar semi-empirical models for the relationship between
$\varepsilon$ and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ of bulk semiconductors have also
been proposed
\cite{Ravindra_1979_eps_Eg,Ravindra_1980_model,Ravindra_2007_Eg_rev}. Despite
the minor difference between the formulae used, it is clear that there
exists certain general electronic relations in bulk
semiconductors. The existence of such general relationship is also of
high practical importance: it is generally more straightforward and
accurate to measure the band gap $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ than the static
dielectric constant $\varepsilon$, as the latter is strongly dependent
on several critical details on the sample measurements, such as
contamination, disorder, and model interpretation. With the Moss
relationship or other similar models, it is feasible to predict the
dielectric constant of a bulk semiconductor with a reasonable degree
of certainty.

While the relation between the electronic and dielectric properties
for bulk semiconductors are well-established, it is unknown if such
relation still exists in low-dimensional materials. For instance,
two-dimensional (2D) materials, the atomically-thin crystalline layers
\cite{Novoselov_2016}, are known to have distinct electronic
\cite{Mak_2010,Tran_2014} and dielectric properties
\cite{Keldysh_1979_eps_multi,Sharma_1985} compared with their bulk
counterparts, making the empirical relations of dielectric constant in
bulk materials, like the Moss relation invalid within the context of
2D materials. More critically, the static dielectric constant, a
quantity associated with the macroscopic dielectric property and
commonly obtained by theoretical calculations of 2D materials
\cite{Ramasubramaniam_2012,Wang_2016_Aip,Laturia_2018}, may not well
describe the microscopic and anisotropic dielectric nature of 2D
materials
\cite{Cudazzo_2010_screen2D,Cudazzo_2011_screening_2D}. Therefore, an
accurate description of the 2D dielectric nature is the prerequisite
for a 2D Moss-like relation. Here we show that instead of the
dielectric constant $\varepsilon$, the 2D polarizabilty $\alpha$
correctly captures the dielectric nature of a 2D material for both
in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations. Based on first principles
simulation of over 50 kinds \todo{some more?} of monolayer 2D
materials, we reveal the long-sought universal dielectric scale
relation in the 2D world: the in-plane polarizability
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ is inversely proportional to the minimal bandgap
$E_{\mathrm{g}}$, while the out-of-plane polarizability
$\alpha^{\perp}$ is closely related with the intrinsic thickness of 2D
materials. The anisotropy of the 2D polarizability is further
explained by a confined quantum model. The universal relations provide
quantitative prediction of the dielectric properties of 2D materials,
which leads to better design and understanding of electronic devices
based on 2D materials and their heterostructures. Furthermore, such
relations bridge the dielectric properties between the 2D materials
and their 3D counterparts, and ultimately pushes the boundary of the
understanding of electronic screening in both dimensions.

\subsection{Dielectric Nature of 2D Materials}
\label{sec:2d}

In persuit of the Moss-like relation of 2D materials, a accurate
description of the dielectric properties of 2D materials needs to be
established. One known issue is that the concept of macroscopic
dielectric constant is ill-defined for 2D materials
\cite{Cudazzo_2010_screen2D,Cudazzo_2011_screening_2D,Nazarov_2015_2D_3D}. As
shown in Figure \ref{fig-1}a \todo{I'll change upon your change of Fig
  1a}, in first principles calculations, an isolated 2D material is
placed at the xy-plane of a periodically repeating superlattice (SL)
with a length $L$ along the z-direction large enough to prevent the
interactions between periodic images. The macroscopic dielectric
tensor from the superlattice $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}$, from
fundamental electrostatics, is determined by the response of
volumetric dipole density $\boldsymbol{P}^{p}$, under small perturbative
external field $\boldsymbol{E}^{q}$, where $p$, $q$ are the
directions in $(x, y, z)$,such that:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
      \label{eq:def-eps-1}
    &\varepsilon^{p} &= \kappa^{pq} +
                                 {\displaystyle \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}^{p}}
                                 {\varepsilon_{0} \partial \boldsymbol{E}^{q}}} \\
          \label{eq:def-eps-2}
    &\boldsymbol{P}^{p} &=  {\displaystyle \frac{\boldsymbol{u}^{p}}{\Omega}}
                          = {\displaystyle \frac{{\displaystyle
          \int_{\mathrm{SL}} \rho(\boldsymbol{r}) \boldsymbol{r}^{p} d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}}}
                          {AL}}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
$\kappa$ is the dielectric tensor of the environment, $\boldsymbol{u}$
is the total dipole moments of the SL, $\rho$ is the spatial charge
density, $\Omega=AL$ is the volume of the SL, $A$ is the xy-plane area
of the SL and $\varepsilon_{0}$ is vacuum permittivity. For the
majority of 2D semiconductors, the off-diagonal elements of the
dielectric tensor ($p \neq q$) tend to be negligible.  Consider that
the 2D material is placed in vacuum, such that $\kappa^{pp} \equiv 1$
and $\kappa^{pq} \equiv 0$, we can distinguish two components of the
SL dielectric tensor, namely the in-plane
($\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\parallel}$) and out-of-plane
($\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\perp}$) dielectric constants, where
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\parallel} =
(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{xx} + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{yy})/2$
and
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\perp} = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{zz}$
\todo{geometry or numerical average?}. Due to the absence of bonding
along the z-direction, the induced charge density of a 2D material is
highly confined. Figure \ref{fig-1}a demonstrates the charge density
difference between zero and finite electric fields,
$\Delta \rho=\rho(\boldsymbol{E}) - \rho(\boldsymbol{E}=0)$ along the
z-axis for an isolated 2H-MoS$_{2}$ layer under
$|\boldsymbol{E}_{z}|=0.01 \mathrm{V\cdot \AA}^{-1}$, which only
extends to ~12 \AA{} along the z-direction inside the SL. When $L$ is
large enough that the induced dipoles from periodic images do not
overlap, the total dipole moments $\boldsymbol{u}$ of the SL in
Eq. \ref{eq:def-eps-2} is independent of $L$. As a consequence, we can
see from Eqs. \ref{eq:def-eps-1} and \ref{eq:def-eps-2}, that both
$\varepsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ and
$\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ depend on the SL length $L$. We
show this by plotting $\epsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ and
$\epsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ as functions of $L$ for 2H-type group
6 transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, 2H-MX$_{2}$, where M=Mo,
W and X=S, Se, Te), in the top panels of Figure \ref{fig-1}b and
\ref{fig-1}c \todo{change order!}, respectively. We can also observe
that neither $\varepsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ nor
$\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{SL}}$ converges with the superlattice
length $L$ due to fact that the long-range Coulomb interaction could
not be completed screened, which is computationally unpractical
\cite{Hueser_2013_2Dvs3D}. The $L$-dependency of macroscopic
dielectric constant makes it erroneous to use
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}$ to present the dielectric nature of a 2D
material. Therefore, we need to find a $L$-independent quantity to
present the intrinsic dielectric properties of the 2D materials. As
discussed previous, since the total dipole moments $\mathbf{u}$ remain
constant with $L$, we can define the surface or sheet polarization
density matrix $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, by multiplying
Eq. \ref{eq:def-eps-2} with $L$, that
$\boldsymbol{\mu}^{p} = \boldsymbol{P}_{p}L = \int_{\mathrm{SL}}
\rho(\boldsymbol{r}) \boldsymbol{r}_{p}d^{3} \boldsymbol{r}/A$,
independent of the superlattice size. Similar to the definition of
molecular polarizability \cite{Israelachvili_2011}, the sheet
polarization density $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is associated with the 2D
polarizability tensor $\alpha$ through:
$\boldsymbol{\mu}^{p} = \sum_{q} \alpha^{pq}
\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{loc}}^{q}$ \cite{T_bik_2004}, where
$E_{\mathrm{loc}}$ is the local electric field. In the in-plane
direction, the continuity of electric field gives
$\mathbf{E}^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{loc}}=\mathbf{E}^{\parallel}$
\cite{Markel_2016}. Perpendicular to the 2D plane, the dipole
screening yields
$\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{loc}}^{\perp}=\boldsymbol{E}^{\perp}+\boldsymbol{\mu}^{\perp}/L$
\cite{Meyer_2001_dipole_slab,T_bik_2004}. Combining with
Eqs. \ref{eq:def-eps-1} and \ref{eq:def-eps-2}, we derive the
expressions for the in-plane and out-of-plane 2D polarizabilities,
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$, respectively:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:alpha-para-def}
  &\alpha^{\parallel} &= \varepsilon_{0}(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\parallel} - 1)L\\
  \label{eq:alpha-perp-def}
    &\alpha^{\perp} &= \varepsilon_{0}\left(1 - {\displaystyle \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\perp}}}\right)L
\end{eqnarray}
The bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig-1}b and \ref{fig-1}c show the
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$ of the TMDCs as functions of
$L$, calculated using Eqs. \ref{eq:alpha-para-def} and
\ref{eq:alpha-perp-def}. We observe that both $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and
$\alpha^{\perp}$ remain almost constant when $L>$15 \AA{}. In
addition, by varying the value of $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and
$\alpha^{\perp}$, we can nicely reproduce the $L$-dependence of
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\parallel}$ and
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\perp}$, respectively (Figure \ref{fig-1}b
and \ref{fig-1}c insets). These findings indicate that the 2D
polarizability, instead of the dielectric constant, is the true
descriptor of the dielectric properties of 2D materials.

We note that the dielectric properties of 2D materials are also often
modeled using an effect medium approach, which treats the 2D material
as a slab with effective permittivity $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{2D}}$ and
thickness $\delta$
\cite{Sharma_1985,Cudazzo_2011_screening_2D,Matthes_2016,Trolle_2017_eps_subst,Laturia_2018}. Such
methods require \textit{a priori} determination of $\delta$, a
quantity with controversial definitions \cite{Mas_Ballest__2011}. In
such approaches, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{2D}}$ and $\delta$ have to be
determined by fitting the $L$-dependent data of
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}$, which is not only computational
expensive, but also fails to capture the anisotropy of the 2D
dielectric properties (details see Supplementary Section S1). On the
other hand, calculating 2D polarizabilities requires no knowledge of
$\delta$ (see Eqs. \ref{eq:alpha-para-def} and
\ref{eq:alpha-perp-def}), and correctly presents the anisotropy of 2D
dielectric nature that $\alpha^{\parallel} > \alpha^{\perp}$.  With
the polarizability as the true descriptor of 2D dielectric properties,
we will reveal the universal Moss-like relation of 2D materials.

\subsection{2D Moss Relations}
\label{sec:first-principles}

We study several types of 2D materials of different electronic and
optical properties, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs,
with the formula MX\(_{\text{2}}\), where M is a metal in group 4, 6,
10 and X=O, S, Se, Te), metal monochalcogenides (Ga$_{2}$S$_{2}$,
Ga$_{2}$Se$_{2}$), cadmium halides (CdX$_2$, X=Cl, I), hexagonal boron
nitride (BN), graphene derivatives (fluorographene (C$_{2}$F$_{2}$),
graphane (C$_{2}$H$_{2}$)) and phosphorene (P$_{4}$).  For the TMDCs,
we consider 2 lattice phases, namely the 2H (P\(\bar{6}\)m2 space
group) and 1T (P3m1 space group).  The structures and elements of the
2D materials are shown in Figure \ref{fig-2}a and \ref{fig-2}b,
respectively. The static 2D polarizabilities are calculated from the
static dielectric response of the selected 2D materials using density
functional theory (DFT) with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid
functionals (HSE06) using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)
including spin-orbit coupling to avoid limitations on the description
of band gaps and dielectric functions. Further details for the first
principle calculations please refer to \textit{Methods}.

Figure \ref{fig-3}a shows the calculated bandgap $E_{\mathrm{g}}$
(blue dots) and polarizabilities (bar plots) of all the 2D materials
investigated, covering a wide bandgap range from far infrared to
ultraviolet. From dimension analysis, it is more intuitive to express
the polarizability as $\alpha/(4 \pi \varepsilon_{0})$, which has unit
of \AA. We find that $\alpha^{\parallel}$ has a general descending
trend when $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ increases. On the other hand, no apparent
trend between $\alpha^{\perp}$ and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ is observed (more
details see Supplementary Section S2.2).  Combining recent theoretical
findings of the universal linear relation between exciton binding
energy $E_{\mathrm{b}}$ and bandgap $E_{\mathrm{b}}$ of 2D materials
\cite{Choi_linear_2015,Olsen_2016_hydrogen,Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}, and the
fact that the $E_{\mathrm{b}}$ is roughly inversely proportional to
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ \cite{Pulci_2014}, it is reasonable to guess that
a general Moss-like relation between $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ and
$1/\alpha^{\parallel}$ may exist for 2D materials. On the other hand,
the bandgap-independent relation of $\alpha^{\perp}$ resembles
molecular polarizabilities of conjugate molecules \cite{Davies_1952},
fullerenes \cite{Sabirov_2014} and carbon nanotubes
\cite{Benedict_1995}, which are shown to be geometry-dependent. Next
we show that the universal Moss-like relations exist for both
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$.

Similar to the treatment of quantum wells (QW), the wavefunction of an
isolated 2D material $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ can be separated into the in-
and out-of-plane components \cite{davies_physics_1997}
$\psi^{\parallel}(\mathbf{\rho})$ and $\psi^{\perp}(z)$, such that
$\psi=\psi^{\parallel}\psi^{\perp}$, where $\mathbf{\rho}=(x, y)$ is
the in-plane coordinate. Using the Bloch theorem, the periodic
$\psi^{\parallel}(\mathbf{\rho})$ can be further expressed as
$\psi^{\parallel}(\mathbf{\rho})=e^{ik\rho}u(\rho)$, where $k$ is the
in-plane wave vector and $u(\rho)$ is periodic function in the
xy-planeAccording to the random phase approximation (RPA)
theory\cite{Adler_1962}, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}$ is the
$\mathbf{q} \to 0$ and $\omega \to 0$ limits of the non-interacting
dielectric function $\varepsilon(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$, where
$\mathbf{q}$ is the momentum transfer and $\omega$ is the frequency:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:RPA-eps2}
  \varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}
  = \lim_{\mathbf{q} \to 0} 1 + \frac{2e^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0} |q|^{2} \Omega}
  \sum_{\mathrm{k, c, v}}
  \frac{|<\psi_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})|e^{-i\mathbf{q}\mathbf{r}}|\psi_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k+q})>|^{2}}
  {E_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k+q}) - E_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})}
  \left[f(\psi_{\mathrm{c}}) - f(\psi_{\mathrm{v}})\right]
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the unit charge, c, v are the conduction and valence
bands, $E$ is the eigenenergy of individual bands, and $f$ is the
Fermi-Dirac distribution function. Taking the limit that $L\to\infty$,
when $\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{SL}} \approx 1$, we have
$1-1/\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{SL}} \approx
(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{SL}}^{\perp} - 1)$. Combine this with
Eqs. \ref{eq:alpha-para-def}, \ref{eq:alpha-perp-def} and
\ref{eq:RPA-eps2}, and taking the difference between the properties of
in-plane and out-of-plane polarizabilities, we derive the expressions
for $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$ under small perturbation
(details see Supplementary Section SXX \todo{mark!}):
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:alpha_para_RPA}
  & \alpha^{\parallel} &= \frac{2e^{2}}
  {(2 \pi)^{2}} \int d^{2}\mathbf{k} \sum_{\mathrm{c, v}}
  \frac{|<u_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})|\nabla|u_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})>|^{2}}
                         {E_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k}) - E_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})} \\
  \label{eq:alpha_perp_RPA}
  & \alpha^{\perp} &= \frac{2e^{2}}{(2 \pi) ^{2}} \int d^{2}\mathbf{k}
  \sum_{\mathrm{c, v}}
  \frac{|<\psi_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})|z|\psi_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k})>|^{2}}
  {E_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k}) - E_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where the integral is performed within the first Brillouin Zone (BZ)
in the reciprocal $\mathbf{k}$-plane. Although they only differ by the
numerator inside the integral, the distinct behaviors of $u(\rho)$
(periodic function) and $\psi(z)$ (confined to the 2D material) give
rise to the different relations of $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and
$\alpha^{\perp}$. Using the $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ theory,
Eq. \ref{eq:alpha_para_RPA} is evaluated to be
$\alpha^{\parallel} = N e^{2}/(2\pi E_{\mathrm{g}})$, where $N$ is the
degeneracy associated with the minimal bandgap
\cite{Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}. On the contrary, $\psi(z)$ is the solution to
the Schr\"{o}dinger equation Hamiltonian
$\mathcal{H} = -\hbar^{2}/2m^{*} \nabla^{2} + V(z)$, where $\hbar$ is
the reduced Planck constant, $m^{*}$ is reduced mass and $V(z)$ is the
confined Coulombic potential along the z-direction created by the
nuclei \cite{davies_physics_1997,ihn_semiconductor_2009}. Using a
simple particle-in-well model, we show that both the numerator and
denominator parts of Eq. \ref{eq:alpha_perp_RPA} are independent of
$E_{g}$ but instead modulated by the size of the potential confinement
(details see Supplementary Section SXX\todo{note}). We further prove,
using both quantum mechanical and fundamental electrostatic models,
that $\alpha^{\perp}$ is actually proportional to the size of
potential confinement (details see Supplementary Section
SXX\todo{note}), which we may relate with the thickness $\delta$ of
the 2D material. Now we may finally propose the 2D analog of the Moss
relation with both in- and out-of-plane polarizations:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:2D-Moss-para}
  &\alpha^{\parallel} &\propto E_{g}^{-1} \\
  \label{eq:2D-Moss-perp}
  &\alpha^{\perp} & \propto \delta
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
which form the main conclusion of this work.

We now validate Eq. \ref{eq:2D-Moss-para} and \ref{eq:2D-Moss-perp}
using the polarizabilities calculated by first principle
calculations. Figure \ref{fig-3}b shows
$(4 \pi \varepsilon_{0})/\alpha^{\parallel}$ (in \AA{}) as a function
of $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ (in eV) for the 2D materials investiaged (circle dots), with a
linear regression slope of ~0.182 and $R^{2}$ of 0.84. From
Ref. \cite{Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}, the slope between
$(4 \pi \varepsilon_{0})/\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $E_{g}$ is
$8\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0} \mathrm{\AA}/(eN) \approx 0.436/N$, which
yields $N$ betweem 2 and 3, which is reasonable for the 2D materials
studied. We observe that materials with lower $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ ($<$4
eV) generally lie close to the regression line, while the deviation
becomes greater for materials with $E_{\mathrm{g}}>$4 eV, which has
also been observed in the $E_{\mathrm{b}}-E_{\mathrm{g}}$ relation of
2D materials \cite{Olsen_2016_hydrogen,Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}. We also
discover that the linearity between
$(4 \pi \varepsilon_{0})/\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ is
better when the bandgap is calculated using the HSE06 hybrid
functionals, compared with that from the Perdew--Burk--Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange correlations (details see Supplementary Section S2 and
Supplementary Figure S5), which can be explained by the fact that the
electronic structure, in particular the bandgap, is generally better
predicted at HSE06 level than PBE level \cite{Heyd_2005}. It should be
noted that although even more accurate estimation of both
$\varepsilon$ and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ can be achieved via many-body
Green’s function method (GW) together with the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (BSE), the convergence of such method is known to be highly
affected by the dielectric screening of 2D materials
\cite{Hueser_2013_2Dvs3D}. Combining the accuracy, computational
effort and convergence, the choice of the HSE06 hybrid functional may
be most suitable to present the true 2D Moss-like relationship between
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$.

We further examine the relation between $\alpha^{\perp}$ and the
thickness of a 2D material proposed in Eq. \ref{eq:2D-Moss-perp}. Here
we choose the thickness of as 2D material as its ``covalent''
thickness $\delta_{\mathrm{cov}}$, which is
defined as the longest distance along the z-direction between any two
atom nuclei plus their covalent radii:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cov-thick}
  \delta_{\mathrm{cov}} = \mathrm{max}(|z_{i} - z_{j}|
  + r_{i}^{\mathrm{cov}} + r_{j}^{\mathrm{cov}})
\end{equation}
where i, j are two atoms in the 2D material and $r^{\mathrm{cov}}_{i}$
is the covalent radius of atom i (Figure \ref{fig-3}c). As shown in
Figure \ref{fig-3}b, $\alpha^{\perp}/(4 \pi \varepsilon_{0})$ indeed
shows an excellent linear correlation with $\delta_{\mathrm{cov}}$,
with $R^{2}=0.98$, and the slope very close to $1/4\pi$. In addition
to our theoretical predictions discussed above, the perfect linear
correlation between $\alpha^{\perp}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{cov}}$ has
its strong physical meaning. Similar to the molecular polarizability
which characterizes the volume of electron cloud of an isolated
molecule \cite{Israelachvili_2011}, the 2D polarizability also
characterizes the volume of the electron cloud of a 2D material per
unit area (from its definition), and naturally represents the
thickness of the electron cloud of the 2D material. The fact that the
thickness of the electron cloud of a 2D material can be approximated
by the extension of valence states in the z-direction, explains the
close match between the linear slope in Figure \ref{fig-3}c and
$1/4\pi$. In other wordst, the universal scaling relation for
$\alpha^{\perp}$ indicates the quantity
$\alpha^{\perp}/\varepsilon_{0}$, is the dielectric characteristic
thickness of a 2D material. We propose that the experimental
measurment of the electronic polarizability
\cite{Antoine_1999,Cherniavskaya_2003,Krauss_1999_EFM}, can also be
extended to measure $\alpha^{\perp}$ of a 2D material, as a direct
estimation of it thickness, in comparison with the optical
ellipsometry techniques \cite{Weber_2010} widely used to estimate the
thickness of 2D materials, which requires empirical optical model and
parameter fitting.

To rule out the possibility that our conclusion is limited by the
number of materials used, we further validate our proposed 2D
Moss-like relations on the recently-published C2DB database
\cite{Haastrup_2018}, from which we extracted the dielectric
properties of over 230 2D materials calculated at the PBE level, and
overlap them with our results in Figure \ref{fig-3}b and \ref{fig-3}c
(further details see Supplementary Section S3). Althought the
dielectric properties may be overestimated at PBE level due to
underestimation of the bandgap compared with the more accurate HSE06
functionals, apparent linear trends can be observed for both
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$, with the linear coefficient
very close to the HSE06 results. Therefore, the proposed universal 2D
Moss-like relations are confirmed.  We have also tested the potential
relation between the 2D polarizabilities with other physical
quantities, including the effective carrier mass, quantum capacitance
and total atomic polarizabilities, while no apparent correlations are
found (details see Supplementary Section S3). 

In short, we have revealed the 2D analog of the Moss relation for both
polarization direction by using the 2D polarizability:
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ is inversely proportional to the minimal bandgap
$E_{\mathrm{g}}$, while $\alpha^{\perp}$ is the characteristic
thickness of the 2D material. Although their apparent forms in
Eq. \ref{eq:2D-Moss-para} and \ref{eq:2D-Moss-perp} seem different, we
will show the 2D Moss-like relations stem from the same origin. In
merit of the unit analysis, $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$
both have unit of $4\pi\varepsilon_{0} \cdot$[Length]. Specifically,
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ and $\alpha^{\perp}$ corresponds to
characteristic lengthes in- and out-of-plane, respectively. The
in-plane screened electrostatic potential $V(r)$ from a point charge
in an 2D plane, as a function of distance $r$,
\cite{Keldysh_1979_eps_multi,Pulci_2014}:
$V(r) = {\displaystyle \frac{e}{4 \alpha^{\parallel}}}
\left[H_{0}({\displaystyle \frac{2\varepsilon_{0}
      r}{\alpha^{\parallel}}}) - Y_{0}( {\displaystyle \frac{2
      \varepsilon_{0}r}{\alpha^{\parallel}}})\right]$, where $H_{0}$
is the Struve function and $Y_{0}$ is the Bessel function of second
kind, is assciated with the in-plane screening radius
$r_{0}^{\parallel}=\alpha^{\parallel}/(2 \varepsilon_{0})$, such that
$V(r,r/r^{\parallel}_{0} \gg 1)$ reduces to the simple Coulombic
potential in vacuum. Combining with the result that the thickness of
2D material is characterized by $\alpha^{\perp}/\varepsilon_{0}$, we
have drawn a generalized picture of the dielectric nature of 2D
materials via the 2D polarizability: the dielectric screening of a
point charge sitting in the middle of a 2D material can be viewed as
an ellipsoid with the length of principle axes to be
$\alpha^{\parallel}/(2 \varepsilon_{0})$ and
$\alpha^{\perp}/(2 \varepsilon_{0})$, respectively, analog to the
polarizability ellipsoid picture of molecules used in spectroscopy
\cite{Banwell_1994}. The in-plane screening length is generally larger
for a smaller bandgap semiconductor, which qualitatively explains the
inverse propotional relation between $\alpha^{\parallel}$ and
$E_{\mathrm{g}}$, a 2D version of the Moss-relation.


\subsection{Bridging the 2D and 3D Dielectric Properties}
\label{sec:2D-3D}

Apart from the universal relations we propose for the 2D materials, it
is also of high theoretical interest to model the transition of
dielectric properties from the 2D world to the 3D world. In other
words, can we describe the dielectric constants of a bulk layered
material from the polarizabilities of the monolayer (see Figure
\ref{fig-4}a)? The static dielectric constants
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ for a bulk material with equilibrium
interlayer distance $L_{\mathrm{bulk}}$, can be expressed using the
polarizabilities of the individual layers in the bulk material
$\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:3D-para}
  &\varepsilon^{\parallel}_{\mathrm{bulk}} &= 1 + {\displaystyle \frac{\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\parallel}}{\varepsilon_{0} L_{\mathrm{bulk}}}}\\
  \label{eq:3D-perp}
  &\varepsilon^{\perp}_{\mathrm{bulk}} &= \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\perp}}{\varepsilon_{0} L_{\mathrm{bulk}}}\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that $\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ may not essentially be the same as
$\alpha$ of isolated layer. Nevertheless we will first see how good
the predictions can be made when assuming
$\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}=\alpha$. Figure \ref{fig-4}b and \ref{fig-4}c
show the comparison between the
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\parallel}$ and
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\perp}$ from first principles DFT
calculations compared with the values predicted using Eqs
\ref{eq:3D-para} and \ref{eq:3D-perp}, respectively. We observe that
such approach provides good estimation of
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\parallel}$, with the mean average error
(MAE) of 1.35. On the other hand, we observe the predicted values of
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}}^{\perp}$ has good agreement with the DFT
values when $E_{\mathrm{g}}>4$ eV, while the deviation becomes larger
when $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ reduces. Such results means that the
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ in a bulk layered material can generally be
estimated from its 2D counterpart, while $\alpha^{\perp}$ differs from
the values of monolayer, as also observed in other studies
\cite{Andersen_2015_dielec_vdWH,Laturia_2018}. Two factors contribute
to the discrepancy: (i) the overlap between induced dipoles is larger
perpendicular to the plane than parallel to the plane, and (ii) the
interlayer coupling is larger for 2D materials with smaller
bandgap. If we have an accuracy approach to model
$\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ as function of $\alpha$ and the degree of
interlayer coupling $\eta$ \cite{Tkatchenko_2012}, the dielectric
transition from 2D to 3D would be smoothly described.

Next we will show how the relation between dielectric properties
transforms from 2D to 3D. Extend the approach for modeling
$\alpha^{\parallel}$ in Eq. \ref{eq:alpha_perp_RPA} to the bulk
material, and use the Bloch presentation for wavefunctions in all
dimensions, we get:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:alpha-Eg-3D}
  \varepsilon_{\mathrm{bulk}} = 1 + \frac{2e^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0}(2\pi)^{3}}\int d^{3}\mathbf{k}
  \frac{|<u_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})|\nabla|u_{\mathrm{v}}(k)>|^{2}}
  {E_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathbf{k}) - E_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})}
\end{equation}
Using a similar treatment for
$|<u_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathbf{k})|\nabla|u_{\mathrm{v}}(k)>|^{2}$ as in
Ref. \citenum{Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb} we end up with the relation
$\alpha_{\mathrm{bulk}} \propto 1/\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{g}}}$ (details see
Supplementary Section SXX \todo{note}), which recovers the Moss
relation under rigorous treatment \cite{Finkenrath_1988}. Therefore,
the universal $\alpha^{\perp}-E_{\mathrm{g}}$ relation is indeed the
Moss relation in 2D world, while the power law of $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ and
independence of effective mass is dominated by the confinement
perpendicular to the 2D plane.

Finally, we would like to comment on the generality of the dielectric
nature between the 2D and 3D worlds. As schematically shown in Figure
\ref{fig-2D-3D}, the physical quantities related to the dielectric
properties can be categorized into (i) strictly 2D (microscopic), (ii)
strictly 3D (macroscopic) and (iii) valid both 2D and 3D.  $\alpha$
and $\varepsilon$ are the starting point for the strictly 2D and 3D
quantities, which require distinct definitions when dimensionality
changes. Such quantities include (but not limited to):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The densities $n_{\mathrm{2D}}$ and $n_{\mathrm{3D}}$ for
  charge, polarization, electronic states, etc.
  
\item The plasma frequencies $\omega^{\mathrm{p}}_{\mathrm{2D}}$ and
  $\omega^{\mathrm{p}}_{\mathrm{2D}}$\cite{Nazarov_2015_2D_3D} (more
  details see Supplementary Section SXX \todo{TBD}).

\item The optical conductivity $\sigma_{\mathrm{2D}}$ and
  $\sigma_{\mathrm{3D}}$\cite{Bechstedt_2012,Matthes_2016}.
\end{enumerate}
These quantities have distinct units in both dimensions, and related
by $L$ (for density and optical conductivity) or $\sqrt{L}$ (for
plasma frequency), which requires prudent interpretation of
theoretical and experimental results. For instance, the experimentally
observed ``dielectric constant'' of monolayer 2D materials
\cite{Ning_2015,Li_2014,Yao_2014,Wu_2015} would be questionable
without considering the effect of mix ted medium. Instead, the 2D slab
polarizability, either transformed from the vacuum-containing
macroscopic dielectric constant, or predicted from the bandgap and
geometry as proposed here, will be a better descriptor for the true 2D
dielectric nature. On the other hand, there are also
dimension-independent quantities that valid for both 2D and 3D
systems, for instance the bandgap $E_{\mathrm{g}}$, exciton binding
energy $E_{\mathrm{b}}$, Bohr radius $r_{\mathrm{B}}$ of the exciton
as well as the Hamaker constant of van der Waals interaction
$A_{\mathrm{H}}$. All these quantities are well-defined and can be
measured in both dimensions, while their relation with the dielectric
property varies with dimensionality. The well-known examples are the
different Wannier-Mott laws for exciton binding energy
\cite{Olsen_2016_hydrogen}, the dielectric-bandgap relation
proposed here, and the distinct power laws for van der Waals
interactions \cite{Gobre_2013}. To get a accuracy description of
dielectric-related properties of the 2D materials and their
heterostructures, one has to distinguish between the 2D and 3D
properties, and choose a suitable relation with the
dimension-dependent and dimension-independent quantities.




\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:org5fd1f1a}

To sum up, using first principles calculation for over 50 kinds of 2D
materials, we reveal the universal relation between the dielectric
nature of 2D materials and other physical quantities via the 2D
polarizability. The in-plane polarizability of a 2D material is found
to be inversely proportional to the minimal bandgap, while the
out-of-plane polarizability is the characteristic thickness of the 2D
material. Such universal scaling relation is explained by a quantum
mechanical model combining the polarizability in both directions. Our
universal scaling relation bridges the gap between 2D and 3D
dielectric properties with good accuracy of prediction.  Our numerical
findings and theoretical analysis pave the way to understand and
engineer the electronic and dielectric properties of a large library
of 2D materials for different technological applications in an
unified and unprecedented way.

\section{Theoretical Methods}
\label{sec:org8457dbb}

All results calculated for this paper were the result of \emph{ab
  initio} simulations carried out using plane-wave Density Functional
Theory (DFT) package VASP
\cite{Kresse_1993,Kresse_1996_1,Kresse_1996_2} using the Projector
Augmented Wave (PAW) approach with Kresse’s mainly GW
Pseudopotentials \cite{Kresse_1999_pseudopotentials}. Band gaps were
calculated using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)
\cite{Heyd_2003,HSE_2006}, with Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC) explicitly
included. The geometries were converged both in cell parameters and
ionic positions, with forces below 0.04 eV/\AA. To ensure the accuracy
of dielectric property of monolayer, a vacuum spacing of $>$ 15 \AA is
used. A k-point grid of \(7\times7\times1\) was used to relax the
superlattice, with an initial relaxation carried out at the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE)\cite{Perdew_1996,Ernzerhof_1999,Paier_2005_PBE}
exchange-correlation functional level and a subsequent relaxation
carried out at HSE06 level, allowing both cell parameters and ionic
positions to relax each time. In VASP, the tag PREC=High was used,
giving a plane wave kinetic energy cutoff of 30\% greater than the
highest given in the pseudopotentials used in each material,
guaranteeing that absolute energies were converged to a few meV and
the stress tensor to within a few kBar.  Calculation of the
macroscopic ion-clamped dielectric tensor were carried out with an
18$\times$18$\times$1 k-grid and electric field strength of 0.001
eV/\AA. Bulk layered materials were constructed by relaxing the c-axis
length of corresponding monolayer material with the interlayer van der
Waals (vdW) interactions calculated by non-local vdW correlation
functional\cite{Lee_2010_vdFD2}. The dielectric properties of bulk
layered materials were calculated at PBE level with
18$\times$18$\times$6 k-grid with same parameter as for monolayer.
