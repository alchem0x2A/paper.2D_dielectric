%Figure S2: PBE results for \(\varepsilon_{\parallel}\) and \(\varepsilon_{\perp}\) versus band gaps}

To demonstrate the validity of the Moss relation for 2D materials we have performed calculations 
at different levels of theory, such as using plain PBE functional (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-S2}), HSE06 hybrid functional (Figure 1) and many-body $G_{\rm 0}W_{\rm 0}$ (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-S3}). Despite of the method utilized all three approaches resulted in clear dependence of $\varepsilon_{\parallel}$ as a 
function of band gaps, and no-dependence of $\varepsilon_{\perp}$. Slight variations of the fitting parameters are observed, which are expected due to the different levels of treatment of the electronic and dielectric properties of the layers. It is worth mentioning however that better accuracy between calculated magnitudes of $\varepsilon_{\parallel}$ and $\varepsilon_{\perp}$ 
are obtained at HSE06 and $G_{\rm 0}W_{\rm 0}$. 

%It should be noted that simulations carried out at the level of PBE functional resulted in considerably larger differences between the model predictions and calculated \(\varepsilon_{\parallel}\) and \(\varepsilon_{\perp}\) (see Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-S4}). Deviations from either a purely linear fitting without a finite cumulative factor at the model, or magnitudes that differ by more than $\sim$24\% between simulations and scaling relations are observed.

\subsection*{Supplementary Note 2: Additional discussions on Moss' description of photoconductivity}

One of the main differences between 
the 2D-Moss relation (Eq.3) and that for 
3D bulk materials (Eq.1)
is the magnitude of the constant relating E$_{g}$ and \(\varepsilon_{\parallel}\). 
Its value was initially set based on the analysis of several 
photoconductors\cite{Moss_1950_relation}, and subsequently for several 
other semiconductors\cite{Moss-book1} with slightly different magnitudes. 
This energy constant can be interpreted 
as a scaling factor for the energy to raise an electron from the ground state into an 
excited state. According to Moss\cite{Moss_1950_relation,Moss52book,Moss59book,Moss_1985_n_Eg}, 
the absorption of a quantum excitation will raise an electron to an excited state rather than freeing it 
from the crystal. Thermal fluctuations will then move this electron into the conduction 
band from the lattice. These excitation points, which can can occur at different lattice sites, 
would behave similarly as in an isolated atom subjected to the 
dielectric constant of the host material\cite{Moss52book,Moss59book}. 
This results that the energy levels of this electron 
at this {\it hydrogenic} system are scaled down by $1/\varepsilon_{\parallel}^{2}$, 
which is equivalent 
to the Moss relation at different dimensionalities (Eq. 1 and 3). 
It is worth mentioning the resemblance of the energy coefficient in Eq.3 in the form of 
$E_g=13.55\varepsilon^{2}$ to the hydrogen ionization energy or Rydberg 
constant $hcR_{\infty}=13.60~eV$ 
for a hydrogenic description of electron-hole excitations 
using a single-particle approach.   
The similarity in this coefficient may suggest that 
photo-electrons stem from the same type of photo-process to the different types of 
hydrogen-like excitation centers. This energy defines the threshold 
wavelength $\lambda_{c}$ shown in Eq.4. 

Moreover, if we carried out the band gap normalization via $E_{g}/\varepsilon_{\parallel}^{2}$ 
over the entire set of materials, as it is displayed 
in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-S5}, we observe that most of the compounds follow similar threshold. 
Interestingly, monolayers with different electronic band gaps, 
such as 1T-NiO$_2$ (3.17 eV) and 2H-HfS$_2$ (1.89 eV), assume similar magnitudes of 
$E_{g}/\varepsilon^{2}$. Conversely, materials at both extremes of the dataset, e.g. 
1T-NiS$_2$ ($E_{g}=1.12$ eV, $\varepsilon_{\parallel}=6.16$) and 1T-HfO$_2$ ($E_{g}=6.49$ eV, 
$\varepsilon_{\parallel}=1.67$), exhibit roughly asymmetric trends on the electronic properties. 
That is, 1T-HfO$_2$ is a well-known insulator material in bulk\cite{Robertson:2004aa} 
but at the monolayer limit it may not 
give desirable dielectric properties because of its low dielectric constant, as it has recently been 
measured\cite{Zhang:2015aa}. 1T-NiS$_2$ in turn 
can develop different metallic or semiconducting properties\cite{Townsend:1971aa,Molla:2016aa} but its high-dielectric constant could be used as a reasonable dielectric. 
This indicates a plethora of potential combinations using band gaps and dielectric constants as key descriptors.

dataset. The average value of $<E_{g}/\varepsilon_{\parallel}^{2}>=$ 0.54 indicates materials where  
the screening contribution is removed almost entirely to the band gap. Deviations from it would indicate 
larger or smaller contributions of the electronic screening to the band edges.

\subsubsection{Supplementary Note 3: Linking excitonic binding energies and dielectric constants}

The band gap may not be the only material property that \(\varepsilon\)
links to. The Claussius-Mossotti equation which
connects the dielectric constant and the molecular polarizability \(\alpha\), is
dependent on \(q\) in strictly 2D systems
\cite{Cudazzo_2011_screening_2D}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Claussius-Mossotti-2D}
\varepsilon(q)^{2D} = 1 + 2\pi \alpha q
\end{equation}

The \(q\)-independent \(\varepsilon\) averaged over the \(q\)-space 
can be derived as\cite{Olsen_2016_hydrogen}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eps-Olsen}
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}}(\alpha, \mu) = 1/2 (1 + \sqrt{1 + 32\pi e^2/3\hbar^2 \alpha \mu})
%\varepsilon^{2D}(\alpha, \mu) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{1 + 32\pi \alpha \mu /3})
\end{equation}
where \(\mu=(m_{\mathrm{n}}^{-1} + m_{\mathrm{p}}^{-1})^{-1}\) is the
effective mass of the exciton. This equation 
establishes a direct relation between dielectric properties 
and specific details on the band structures of a given material. 
Using different values of $\mu$ and $\alpha$ for different classes of layered crystals
we can compare results obtained using Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Olsen} with those calculated 
using HSE06 as indicated in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-4}{\bf a}.  %The values of \(\alpha\) and \(\mu\) of the selected 2D materials are adapted from the results in Ref. \citenum{Rasmussen_2015_database}. 
There is a sound agreement between both approaches with most of the data points within 
the prediction margin of 90\% fidelity as shown in the violet stripe. 
Interestingly, we find that the two sets of data show almost a
linear correlation, with a linearly fitted slope of 0.95. Such results
indicate that \(\varepsilon\) does indeed relate to the internal band structures
of 2D materials, which are reflected by \(\alpha\) and \(\mu\). We also
notice that almost all the data points of the \(\varepsilon\) from the
polarizability model lie above the line \(y=x\), with a fitted
$y$-intercept of 1.39. The difference between the model predicted values of 
$\varepsilon^{2D}(\alpha, \mu)$ and our calculations 
may be due to the existence of long-range
Coulombic interactions $1/r$ in the Hartree-Fock exact 
exchange functional $E_{xc}^{HSE}$ even with a void
distance as large as 2 nm out of the plane, which results in \(\varepsilon_{\perp}\)
slightly higher than 1. 
The dielectric screening along the 
z-direction is not included in Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Olsen} which is also derived assuming 
an average screening felt by the exciton. Even though such limitations are present, 
a mean prediction error of less than 1.5 is observed. With the implementation 
of a truncated Coulombic interaction function in the HSE06 
calculations\cite{Hueser_2013_2Dvs3D},
the discrepancy between both approximations may be even reduced.

The coefficient of determination $R^2$ is shown in both panels. The violet areas define a

}
\end{figure}


%There is a recent revival of relating exciton binding energies with other quantities, e.g. band gaps\cite{Choi_linear_2015,Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}.  

Other important quantity that is related to the dielectric constant and in general with the screening 
properties is the exciton binding energy. From the Wannier
model of exciton in strictly 2D systems, the binding energy
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) is scaled by \(\varepsilon^{2}\) \cite{Yang_1991}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Wannier-2D}
E_{\mathrm{b}}^{\mathrm{2D}} = \frac{2 \mu e^4}{\varepsilon^2 \hbar^2 }
%E_{\mathrm{b}}^{\mathrm{2D}} = \frac{2 \mu}{\varepsilon^{2}}
\end{equation}
which indicates that the accuracy on $\varepsilon$ is the key factor apart from the 
established limitations of the model. If accurate values of $\varepsilon$ are utilized
from HSE06 simulations we can bridge this simple model to 
higher-levels of theory, 
such as using many-body Green's function method ($GW$) together 
with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) which is a routine but expensive scheme to 
estimate \(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) for different 2D materials. Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-4}{\bf b} shows that this correlation does exist. 
Two regimes can be found comparing both sets of data: when
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) from $GW$ is smaller than 0.75 eV, both
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) values are close and lie along \(y=x\); while
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) from $GW$ is large than 0.75 eV, the model predicted
values give larger deviation and higher overestimation. This can be
explained by the limitation of the current model: the 2D Wannier model
neglects the contribution from higher quantum numbers, and is more
accurate for materials with higher \(\alpha\) (hence lower
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\)) \cite{Olsen_2016_hydrogen}. We note that the 2D
exciton model works relatively well for group 6 and 10 TMDCs, while
for group 14 materials the deviation is relatively larger. The
validity of the 2D Wannier exciton model has its practical importance:
calculation of the exciton binding energy usually involves virtual
orbitals and solving BSE self-consistently, which requires much
more computation resources than ground state DFT calculations. The
relationship between the exciton binding energies and 
dielectric constants favors bidirectional
prediction of both quantities: \(\varepsilon\) can be estimated from \(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) assessed by
spectroscopy experiments, and the computationally-expensive
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) can also be predicted by facile obtainable \(\varepsilon\). 
In fact, one alternative to this framework 
would be the estimation of $\varepsilon$ using 
the scaling relationships in Eqs. 3 and 5, 
and then Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:Wannier-2D} for the binding energies. The only external parameter 
in this scheme would be band gap, which considerably reduce the number of 
unknown variables.  

Considering the similarity between the \(\varepsilon-E_{\mathrm{g}}\) and
\(\varepsilon-E_{\mathrm{b}}\) relations, that both are scaled with
1/\(\varepsilon^{2}\), one may guess whether such scaling relation between \(\varepsilon\)
and the atomistic energies are of similar origin. In fact, recent
quantum chemistry studies reveal the existence of a linear
relation between \(E_{\mathrm{g}}\) and the exciton binding energy
\(E_{\mathrm{b}}\) in 2D materials
\cite{Choi_linear_2015,Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}, which is distinct for the 
bulk systems where the effective mass also plays a role. Important in these predictions 
is the close relation between the 2D polarizability \(\alpha\)$^{2D}$ and 
\(E_{\mathrm{g}}\). Indeed, when \(\alpha\)$^{2D}$ is large, it gives 
$\alpha_{\mathrm{2D}} = N_{\mathrm{g}} e^{2} / 8 \pi^2 \epsilon_{0}^2 E_{\mathrm{g}}$, where
\(N_{\mathrm{g}}\) is the degeneracy of the bands and normally assumed
to be 6 for hexagonal symmetry\cite{Jiang_2017_Eg_Eb}. 
Combining this with Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Olsen} we get 
the relation between \(\varepsilon\) and \(E_{\mathrm{g}}\):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eps-Eg-derive}
\varepsilon(\varepsilon - 1) = \frac{N_{\mathrm{g}} e^4 \mu}{3 \pi \hbar^2 \varepsilon_{0}^{2} E_{\mathrm{g}}}
%\varepsilon (\varepsilon - 1) = \frac{4 N_{\mathrm{g}} \mu}{3 E_{\mathrm{g}}}
\end{equation}
\\
and in the small band gap regime it may be simplified as 
$\varepsilon = \sqrt{\frac{N_{\mathrm{g}} e^4 \mu}{3 \pi \hbar^2 \epsilon_{0}^{2} E_{\mathrm{g}}}}$, 
which is also
equivalent to plugging the linear relation between \(E_{\mathrm{g}}\)
and \(E_{\mathrm{b}}\), with \(E_{\mathrm{b}} = 3 E_{\mathrm{g}} / 2
N_{\mathrm{g}}\), into the 2D Wannier model in Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:Wannier-2D}. 
The inverse-square relation between \(\varepsilon\)
and \(E_{\mathrm{g}}\) is thus restored. A comparison between the
\(\varepsilon\) from Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Eg-derive} and the calculated HSE06 magnitudes, 
can be seen in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-S7}. 
We note a larger deviation using this model than the
magnitudes extracted from Supplementary Eq. \ref{eq:eps-Olsen} as 
show in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-4}{\bf a}, 
as the accumulated error in all the
assumptions used in such model. Nevertheless, using the quantum
perturbation theory, it is possible to reveal the general
inverse-square law between \(E_{\mathrm{b}}-\varepsilon\) and
\(E_{\mathrm{g}} - \varepsilon\).

\subsubsection{Supplementary Note 4: Multiscale calculations between monolayer and bulk}

With the insight that a single descriptor can link electronic and dielectric features in 2D materials, 
we are able to generate a simple model that describes the ability 
to predict \(\varepsilon_{\parallel}\) in two-dimensions from the details 
of the electronic structure of the 3D-bulk. Therefore, we shift our focus to a 
multiscale approach to this problem as this is more relevant for a 
unification of the concepts from monolayer materials to thin films. 
The close relation between the real part of the dielectric function 
and its imaginary component can be used to this goal. 
The Lindhard theory gives the wave vector \(q\)-dependency of dielectric
functions in both 2D and 3D systems \cite{Dressel:2002aa}:

where \(\Psi\) is the Coulombic potential, \(E\) is the energy of the
state, and \(f\) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. For
semiconductors, the state $| k+q,l'>$ is in the valence band (VB), and state $|k, l>$ is
in the conduction band (CB). Using the relation \(\sum_{k,l,l'} (E_{k+q, l'} - E_{k,l})
\vert <k+q, l' \vert e^{iqr} \vert k, l > \vert ^{2} \approx 2 N_{e}
E_{q}\) \cite{Slyom_2008_fundBook}, where \(N_{e}\) is the electron density
of the bands, and \(E_{q}=\hbar^{2} q^{2} / 2 \mu\) is the energy at
wavevector \(q\). The Lindhard dielectric function at the long
wavelength limit (\(q \to 0\)) can be rewritten as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Lindhard-derived}
\varepsilon(q, \omega) = 1 + \frac{\Psi(q)}{E_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}}{}2 N_{e} E_{q}
\end{equation}
%
The difference between the dimensions is reflected by the difference
in the form of \(\Psi(q)\): the Fourier-transformation of Coulombic
interaction potential in 2D and 3D systems give:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Psi-2D-3D}
\Psi^{\mathrm{3D}}(q) = \frac{e^2}{\epsilon_{0} q^{2} \Omega^{\mathrm{3D}}}  \\ 
\Psi^{\mathrm{2D}}(q) = \frac{e^2}{2\epsilon_{0} q \Omega^{\mathrm{2D}}}
% \Psi^{\mathrm{3D}}(q) &= \displaystyle \frac{4 \pi e^{2}}{q^{2} \Omega^{\mathrm{3D}}} \\
% \Psi^{\mathrm{2D}}(q) &= \displaystyle \frac{2 \pi e^{2}}{q \Omega^{\mathrm{2D}}}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where \(\Omega^{\mathrm{3D}}\) and \(\Omega^{\mathrm{2D}}\) are unit
volumes in 3D and 2D systems, respectively. The transition energy from
VB to CB in semiconductors, \(E_{k+q, l'}-E_{k, l}\), can be
approximated by the band gap \(E_{\mathrm{g}}\). When \(\omega \to 0\), we
have:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:eps-Lindhard-3D}
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}}(q) &= 1 + \displaystyle \frac{q^{2} e^{2} N_{e}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \mu \Omega^{\mathrm{3D}}} \frac{E_{q}}{E_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}}
                          &= 1 + (\displaystyle \frac{\hbar \omega^{\mathrm{3D}}_{p}}{E_{\mathrm{g}}})^{2} \\
\label{eq:eps-Lindhard-2D}
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}}(q) &= 1 + \displaystyle \frac{q e^{2} N_{e}}{4 \pi \mu \Omega^{\mathrm{2D}}} \frac{E_{q}}{E_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}}&= 1 + (\displaystyle \frac{\hbar \omega^{\mathrm{2D}}_{p}(q)}{E_{\mathrm{g}}})^{2} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
where \(\omega^{3D}\) and \(\omega^{\mathrm{2D}}\) are the plasma
frequencies in 3D and 2D (\(q\)-dependent), respectively.  We therefore
arrives at the conclusion of \(q\)-dependent dielectric response of 2D
systems. For a 3D material 
which is composed of stacks of 2D materials with inter-layer 
distance L (see Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-6}{\bf a}), it is 
straightforward comparing Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Lindhard-3D} and
Supplementary Eq.\ref{eq:eps-Lindhard-2D}, that the 2D and 3D dielectric constants are related as:
%
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relation-2D-3D}
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}}(q) &= 1 + \frac{\Omega^{\mathrm{3D}}}{2 \Omega^{\mathrm{2D}}} (\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1)q \\
                          &= 1 + \frac{L}{2}(\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1)q
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Using a relation between the molecular polarizability \(\alpha\)$^{2D}$ and \(\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}}\), through
 \(\alpha^{\mathrm{2D}}= L/4\pi (\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1)\)\cite{Cudazzo_2010_screen2D}, where $L$ is the layer thickness, and 
$\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}}(\alpha, \mu) = 1/2 (1 + \sqrt{1 + 32\pi e^2/3\hbar^2 \alpha \mu})$\cite{Olsen_2016_hydrogen}, 
where \(\mu=(m_{\mathrm{n}}^{-1} + m_{\mathrm{p}}^{-1})^{-1}\) is the
effective mass of the exciton, we finally get the relation between the high-frequency 2D dielectric constant and its 3D counterpart:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eps-2D-3D-final}
%\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{8 e^2 L \mu}{3 \hbar^2 (\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1)}})  %new Eq.
%\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}} = \displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} (\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1) \mu L} %old Eq. 
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 e^2 L \mu^{2}}{3\hbar^{2}} (\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}} - 1)} %old Eq. w/ SI units
\end{equation}
%
Such relation is relatively simple yet strong, showing that the 2D and
3D dielectric constants are bridged by the bulk electronic structure 
(reflected by \(\mu\)). This relation can be tested for 21 layered materials with reported
magnitudes of \(\varepsilon\) in both 2D and 3D (see Supplementary Table 1) relative to the 
HSE06 hybrid calculations as shown in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig-6}{\bf b}. 
Strikingly, the two sets of data show
a good agreement with a small mean average error (MAE) of
0.448. All 2D-compounds analyzed follow the linear trending curve, 
and many fall in the limit of fidelity of 95\% of the prediction 
despite of geometry and the nature of the band gap. Undoubtedly, 
the existence of such universal relation between
\(\varepsilon^{\mathrm{2D}}\) and \(\varepsilon^{\mathrm{3D}}\) greatly
facilitates the understanding of the dielectric constants of a broad variety of 2D
materials, giving prediction values with reasonable accuracy from its 3D-bulk analogue.
